# Taping Memory

## Introduction

This is the source code for my blog [Taping Memory](https://taping-memory.herokuapp.com/).

Save for some small glue code and CSS, it's completely written in Rust thanks to, [Actix-web](https://actix.rs/) and [Yew](https://yew.rs/)

This is a **WIP** also it runs only in nightly.

I'm currently working in the first article explaining how I made this blog.

## TODO (In no particular order)

* [ ] Migrate the articles out of this repo
* [ ] Improve accessibility
* [ ] Improve loading performance
* [ ] Add a database for the articles
* [ ] Separate into server/front-end/common crates
